`berry` is a healthy, byte-sized window manager written in C for unix systems.
Its main features include:

* Controlled via a powerful command-line client, allowing users to control windows via a hotkey daemon such as [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd)
or expand functionality via shell scripts.
* Small, hackable [source code](https://github.com/jlervin/berry).
* Extensible themeing options with double borders, title bars, and window text.
* Intuitively place new windows in unoccupied spaces.
* Virtual desktops.

If you're totally new to using a standalone window manager you might find the
[Setup Guide](/walkthrough.html) page helpful.
If you've used window managers like `bspwm` or `i3` you can likely skip this step and
go straight to the [Installation](/installation.html) page.
