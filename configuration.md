# Configuration

### Basic

`berry` is configured via its command-line client: `berryc`.
Upon startup, `berry` will attempt to run the `autostart` file located by default
in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/berry/autostart`.
A sample autostart has been included to help you.

Note that `berry` can be configured at runtime by running any `berryc` command.

The following are a list of `berryc` commands that affect the internal state of `berry`'s config.
To use any of these, simply prepend the command `berryc` followed by the command and it's respective arguments.

### Example
```python
#Sets the color of the inner border for the focused window to white
berryc inner_focus_color ffffff
```
